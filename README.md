# nano_llm

A small LM model I made to learn more about PyTorch. I am using Andrej Karpathy's [Names Dataset](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/names.txt).

The goal is to build out a language model which embeds characters into a vector space and then produces the next most likely character, to construct stuff.
